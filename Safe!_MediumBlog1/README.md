# Safe! The Effect of Batting Hand on Making it to FirstÂ Base
This is the repo for my first data blog on Towards Data Science. https://towardsdatascience.com/safe-the-effect-of-batting-hand-on-making-it-to-first-base-b89ac3a1888 I've included several scripts in this folder:

(1) A data formatter script, used to clean and split data sets into left handed, right handed, and switch hitter datasets

(2) Figure 2. generator script

(3) Figure 3. generator script

(4) Figure 4. generator script

(5) Figure 5. generator script

I've also included the data files I used to do my analysis and make the figures. If you have questions drop me a line!
